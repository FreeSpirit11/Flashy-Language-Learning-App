# Flashy-Language-Learning-App
"Flashy-Language-Learning-App" is an interactive and engaging tool designed to help users learn foreign languages in a fun and effective way.
It displays commonly used words in the chosen language and their translations, making language learning more practical and relevant for everyday conversations.
The app presents the words in flashcards, providing an interactive learning experience that aids memory retention and practice.

## Features

- Flashcards for Interactive Learning: The app uses flashcards to present words in your chosen language along with their translations, creating an engaging and interactive learning experience.

- Automatic Card Flip: After a few seconds, the app automatically flips the flashcard to reveal the translation, giving you time to think and attempt to guess the word before seeing the answer.

- Right and Wrong Buttons: When you know the word on the flashcard, click the "Right" button to remove it from the current session. If you need more practice, click the "Wrong" button to see the word again later.

- Random Word Selection: The app selects words randomly for each session, providing a varied learning experience and ensuring you practice different words each time.

- Progress Tracking: Easily track your progress by removing words you've learned or clicking the "Wrong" button to review words you need more practice with.
